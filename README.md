# Design2-CombatSimuation

This is a simple Battle Simulator for an invented RPG game for Game Design 2 at CITM - UPC (Game Development and Design Degree).

Since I wanted to do an RPG like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, I added the option to have multiple players and enemies instead of a 1 vs 1. All characters have the same 4 options to act on their turn. Attack an enemy, heal an ally with an item (has 3 charges), buff an ally's attack and prepare a trap in front of an ally that damages the next enemy to attack him.  


# Release

The release doesn't fit in Github, so download it here:

It contains a build of the battle against the Boss and another one to play a 2 vs 2.
If you want to change the character's levels or statistics open the scenes in unity and change the character's values on the inspector.
